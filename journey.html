      My journey with photgraphy felt like an adventure. When I was
      11 years old my father bought me my first camera, since then
      the enthusiam captured my heart. I took a lot of terriable,
      fuzzy images in the first months. At first, I didn't know any technique that I should follow to take
      pictures, I have never taken a class or course about photography.

      Day after day I've learned that there is a lot of rules and techniques that I should follow
      to become a photographer. Photography has become my hobby, at everytime I hang out with my friends they let me help them in taking their pictures.
      I've took +10,0000 photos in the last two years!.

      Today I do storngly believe that great photographs become a great photographs because of
      passion and the person's ability to convey something exceptional through a photograph.
